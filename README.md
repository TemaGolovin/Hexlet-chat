## Description

Hexlet chat is a simplified version of slack, where you can exchange messages in real time, as well as add, rename and delete channels, due to the fact that web sockets are implemented in the project.

The project is based on React and Redux Toolkit. REST API is used, authorization and user authentication.

Notifications about user actions, filtering obscene words and expressions are used. to collect information about errors that occur from users, it is transferred to the error collector for their quick elimination.
